## My Interests:

**Embedded** systems and **real time** (video gaming) are my field of expertise.
Projects requiring **data acquisition** (real world data input - manually or automatically),
data display (GUI) and data communications (networking or other methods) are my primary interests.

Ever since HTML5 and **webGL** have been available - this has become my main focus powering all of my projects currently.
I continue to write server-side generated page scripts and client-side created pages (with the myriad of frameworks available out there).

I have also designed, setup and brought online - small and medium sized automated **high availability systems**.
Although these are now provided by a number of service providers (such AWS, GCE, Rackspace, etc.) - I
still make some on-site for internal and propeitary needs.

<!--
The following is primarily for cold calling recruiters. Offers I am NOT looking for:

- Supporting old, dying or dead tech
- I do not want a (tech) documentation writing offer. I will only write documentation on projects that I have been involved with from the beginning. 

- Do not call me if the job is for a tech support monkey position, a lab (maintenance) baby sitter or a tester position (where the fun work has already been completed).
- But, if there are needs for solutions in designing the lab infrastructure or there are needs for designing new testing applications, then I "might" consider the offer. 


Do NOT contact me about joining your resume search engine either. All of those requests will be ignored.

Please DO include a description of the offer when you contact me about your inquiry. Offers that are not specific will result in longer reply delays.
